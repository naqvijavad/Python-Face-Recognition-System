# Python Face Recognition System

## Overview

Welcome to the "Python Face Recognition System" project repository. This project focuses on a desktop application designed for face recognition, attendance management, and timecard recording using Python. The system leverages OpenCV and the Haar Cascade algorithm to achieve an impressive 85% accuracy rate in face recognition. Additionally, it offers user registration, Turbo Mode for faster processing, and a Data Backup feature to enhance time management.

## Features

- Face recognition with an 85% accuracy rate.
- Attendance management and timecard recording.
- User registration system.
- Turbo Mode for faster data processing.
- Data Backup functionality for streamlined time management.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- OpenCV
